# Typescript-Scripts

This repository is used by me to standardise various configuration for Typescript codebases
that I create. By using these scripts I am able to maintain the configuration in one
centralized place rather than repeating the same process for each codebase.

Inspired by `react-scripts` and `kcd-scripts`.


## Scripts

- init

    Initialises a repository for Typescript development. Currently it only checks that typescript
    is installed and creates a tsconfig.json file for you if it doesn't already exist.

- lint (TODO)

- compile (TODO)

- test (TODO)
